# SP-Project

Project for the course "Signal Processing"

Question 1: Echo Creation

            Given an audio signal, implemented creation of echoes using filters

Question 2: Echo Cancellation

            Given audio signal, generated an algorithm to cancel echo using autocorrelation and adaptive filters

Question 3: Noise Classification

            Developed an algorithm for classifying noise in an audio signal using cross-correlation
